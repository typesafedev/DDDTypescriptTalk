# Values vs Entity

## Entity has an identity and history

## Refer to philosopher's axe

## After being replaced many times (handle and head)

## Is it the same axe when no original parts remain

* Yes, if it is an entity
* No, if it a value

## If you keep the replaced original parts and construct another axe, is it still the same axe
